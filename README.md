## Radio Thermostat

This is a web interface to fetch the state and issue commands directly to a Radio Thermostat. It is a work-in-progress and will need some dev work to function in production. Currently functions when run through the webpack dev server.

## Configure

Update thermostat IP address, and desired temperature units (FA/CE) here:

### `config.env`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
